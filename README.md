# GitHubUser_AndroidApp
This is an exercise repository for Android application development using Kotlin. The application is GitHub's User Search. This application use [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/quickstart?apiVersion=2022-11-28) to retrieve the data of users. I use RecyclerView for the users list. I'm using MVVM architecture to build this app.
